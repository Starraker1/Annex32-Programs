Annex32-Book-of-Programs

These programs are taken directly from Annex32 RDS Forum and are the work of many authors and are written in Annex32 BASIC.

Some of them require specific modules and firmware to operate properly but all them had been tested at the time of publication.

Members of the Forum can access details and the required firmware.

RDS refers to a Rapid Development System.

Annex32 is a product of Francesco Ceccarella (CICCIOCB) who owns the copyright to the firmware which is freely available on 
becoming an Annex32 Forum member. The firmware is flashed into ESP8266, ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C2, 
ESP-CAM and ESP32-P4 modules (bare, with display, with screen, touchscreen , and VGA) and programs operate interpretively from 
the module's memory. This allows much faster turn around time for the development of programs as there is no flashing or 
compilation required to test programs - just run it straight from the inbuilt program or line editors.  There is also a built in 
File Manager, Configuration Manager and Web Output Screen.

The Annex32 BASIC is a powerful dialect of this well known 3rd Generation programming language and includes all aspects of the language 
from PEEKs and POKEs to a full optioned implementation of LVGL and LovYan GFX, some custom commands for sensors and options for aspects
of the setup plus all of the usual BASIC commands. It also gets around the problems associated with screens and inbuilt sensors by 
having dedicated selectable Module implementations for most commercially available ESP Modules, touch, screens and displays, VGA and 
HMI devices. Also because the firmware is located in the ESP device, the programs run at a much higher speed - approaching a speed 
near to a compiler language especially on S3 and P4 devices which have ample memory.   Many users achieve fully working programs in
much less than a day and fully developed complex multi level / multi input LVGL programs in two to three days.
